## Preface

Being a Fullstack developer(backend heavy, node.js and react.js/next.js). I wanted to explore the mobile app development. I have used the [playlist of DesignIntoCode](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqtWgQ5BRLPvbmeIYf769yb25g4W8NUZo) YouTube channel.  
In video, presenter used all the class component and I have used all the functional component here. Almost all color and theme are copied.

Final code of this video will be in branch `video-final`. Checkout to it as I might be coding around to learn more.
